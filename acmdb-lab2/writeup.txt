Writeup for Lab2

I record the last operating time of each page in BufferPool and evict the earliest one. 

I implement Tuple.equals() since I've heard some of my classmates failed the system test of BTreeFileInsertTest because of the not implemented Tuple.equals() during our communicating, while none of them have new-ed a Tuple. 

I feel confused with the description of IndexPredicate.equals() since I think it's nothing related to equals() and do not know how to use it in my project. 

And it costs me 2-3 days to complete this lab.
